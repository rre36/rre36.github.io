#### What is the Nostalgia Shader?

It is a shaderpack meant to replicate the look and feel of "first-gen" shaderpacks (Seus v08, Chocapic v3 etc.) while also adding new features and visual effects like volumetric fog.

#### What are the features/effects that this shaderpack has?

* custom skybox and lighting colors
* dynamic shadows
* wind effects
* shader based vanilla styled clouds (including an option for story mode styled clouds)
* second layer of volumetric clouds (partially inspired by super duper pack, but better)
* volumetric fog
* reflections
* resourcepack support
* motionblur
* bloom
* temporal anti aliasing
* some more I forgot about right now
